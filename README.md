# 👋 Hi there!

I'm a developer exploring the cosmos of code, one line at a time.

## 🚀 Currently Learning

- **Java** ☕ - Building my foundation in object-oriented programming
- **Python** 🐍 - Exploring its versatility and simplicity

## 🌌 Interests

I'm fascinated by space and everything beyond our atmosphere. From nebulae to neural networks, I love exploring both the universe and the digital frontier.

## 💫 What I'm Working On

Right now I'm focused on strengthening my programming fundamentals while working on projects that combine my passion for coding and space exploration.

## 📫 Let's Connect

Feel free to reach out if you want to collaborate on a project or just chat about space, code, or anything in between!
